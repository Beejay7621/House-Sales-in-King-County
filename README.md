# House-Sales-in-King-County
This project involves determining the market price of a house given a set of features.  This is as a resuklt of a Real Estate Investment Trust that would like to start investing in Residential real estate.  I analyze and predict housing prices using attributes or features such as square footage, number of bedrooms, number of floors, and so on.  The dataset used in this project contains house sale prices for King County.  It includes homes sold between May 2014 and May 2015.
